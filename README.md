# SFML_Slider

This is a standalone slider that you can use in SFML projects.
At the time I created this project I did not know anything about Inheritance or any Design Pattern at all.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites and basic information

- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- This repo does not provide an executable -> you have to compile your own (I used Visual Studio)
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for C++ and OpenGL
- All dependencies are included in this repo, so it is almost plug and play :)

## Installation

1. Clone Repository
`git clone https://github.com/tp-codings/SFML_Slider.git`
2. Build Executable (e.g. Visual Studio)

# Usage
- Include Slider Header in project
- with setter and getter you can modify the Slider as you need (colors, range, position, ...).
- see source code for more info (it is not that much)
