# SFML_Slider

This is a standalone slider that you can use in SFML projects.
At the time I created this project I did not know anything about Inheritance or any Design Pattern at all. 

# Usage
- Include Slider Header in project
- with setter and getter you can modify the Slider as you need (colors, range, position, ...).
- see source code for more info (it is not that much)
